I am [James Manrique](https://www.notion.so/jrmanrique/James-Manrique-2cad7ae491aa480796927f10821069b0), currently a linguistics student. I mainly write about linguistics, languages, and programming.

I have dabbled with a lot of things. That includes:
- *Programming.* I have been coding since 2010, mainly front-end for landing pages but picked up other languages for automation, computing, and small-scale development.
- *Translation.* I have worked as a translator for Korean media organizations, mainly working with live microblogs and news articles as source texts.
- *Lexicography.* I have contributed in building seed dictionaries for some Philippine languages.
- *Accounting and Finance.* I was an accountancy student before I shifted to linguistics.
- *Statistics and Econometrics.* We studied data science for business but I have since explored other applications such as modeling and corpus linguistics.
-  *Systems Analysis and Design.* We also studied business IT which led me to exploring full-stack programming. For this class, we have designed an entire information systems and its corresponding workflow for a residence hall in the university.
- *Creatives.* I have extensive experience in graphic, video, and audio editing.
